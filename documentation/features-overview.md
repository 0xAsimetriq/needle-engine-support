Needle Engine utilizes the [Unity Editor Lightmapper ⇡](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/progressive-lightmapper.html) to easily bake static light for your 3d content.

> **Note**: There is no technical limitation on which lightmapper to use so you could also use a third party lightmapper like [Bakery ⇡](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/level-design/bakery-gpu-lightmapper-122218) for the job.

## Multiplayer and Networking
Networking is built into the core runtime. Needle Engine deployments to Glitch come with a tiny server that allows you to deploy a multiplayer 3d environment in seconds. Needle Engine comes with some networked components that make it easy to get started. Synchronizing variables and state is super easy!

## Animation
Needle Engine animations are super powerful. From just playing a single animation to orchestrating and blending multiple complex and dynamic animations - we got you covered. 
### AnimatorController
The powerful AnimationController in Unity lets you setup animations and define conditions for when and how to blend between them.
### Timeline
