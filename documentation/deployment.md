# Deployment ‚öí

Needle Engine is tightly integrated into the Unity Editor:  
Open ``File/Build Settings`` and select ``Needle Engine`` for options!

To deploy your threejs project you can click ``Build`` in the Unity Editor Build Settings Window. You can enable the ``Development Build`` checkbox to omit compression (see Deploying for production below) which requires toktx to be installed on your machine.

*Note: that Nodejs is **only** required during development. The distributed website (using the vite template) is not relying on Nodejs and can be used on any regular server.*

### Deploying for development
See notes above on how to access. The main difference to a production build is that it does not perform [``ktx2`` ‚á°](https://github.khronos.org/KTX-Specification/) and [``draco`` ‚á°](https://google.github.io/draco/) compression. Both can reduce file-size drastically. We generally recommend making builds using the ``production`` option.

### Deploying for production (optimized and compressed)
To make a production build you need to have [toktx ‚á°](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/KTX-Software/releases) to be installed (for compressing your files). Please go to the [github releases ‚á°](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/KTX-Software/releases) and download and install the latest version of toktx. You may need to restart Unity after installing it. 

NOTE: when building for production using custom extensions make sure to handle those in ``gltf-transform``, see ``needle.tiny.engine/plugins/gltf-packer`` for reference.
