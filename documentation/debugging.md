## üîç Useful resources for working with glTF

To inspect glTF or glb files online:
- [gltf.report](https://gltf.report/) - three.js based
- [modelviewer.dev/editor](https://modelviewer.dev/editor) - three.js based
- [Khronos glTF Sample Viewer](https://github.khronos.org/glTF-Sample-Viewer-Release/)
- [Babylon Sandbox](https://sandbox.babylonjs.com/)
- [glTF Validator](https://github.khronos.org/glTF-Validator/)

To inspect them locally:
- use the [glTF Shell Extension for Windows](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/gltf-shell-extensions/9NPGVJ9N57MV?hl=en-us&gl=US) to convert between glTF and glb
- use the [glTF Tools VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cesium.gltf-vscode) to see validation errors and in-engine previews locally


## üîñ Built-in URL parameters

Debug Flags can be appended as URL query parameters.  
Use ``?help`` to get a list of ALL parameters available.  

Here are some of the most commonly used:

- ``help`` print all available url parameter in the console
- ``printGltf`` logs loaded gltf files to the console
- ``debug`` shows transform gizmos (if any)
- ``debugavatar=<avatarid>`` instantiates one debug avatar in center of world
- ``debugphysics`` shows physics colliders
- ``gizmos`` enables gizmo rendering (e.g. when using BoxCollider or AxesHelper components)
- and a lot more: please use ``help`` to see them all

## üßê Local Testing of release builds
- First, install http-server: `npm install -g http-server`
- make a build (development or production)
- open the *dist* directory with a commandline tool
- run `http-server -g` | *`-g` enables gzip support*  
- optional: if you want to test WebXR, generate a [self-signed SSL certificate](https://stackoverflow.com/a/35231213), then run `http-server -g -S` to enable https (required for WebXR).

## üì± Mobile 

### Android Debug

See the official chrome documentation [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/remote-debugging/)
- [Activate Developer Mode](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options)
- Connect your phone to your computer via USB
- Open this url in your browser ``chrome://inspect/#devices``
- On your mobile device allow the USB connection to your computer
- On your computer in chrome you should see a list of open tabs after a while (on ``chrome://inspect/#devices``)
- Click ``Inspect`` on the tab you want to debug

### Quest Debug
For **Quest**, you can attach Chrome Dev Tools to your device and see logs right from your PC. You have to switch your device into development mode and connect it via USB.
