# Samples and Modules ðŸ”­

Projects can be composed of re-usable pieces that we call [**npmdef**](./project_structure.md#npm-definition-files) (which stands for Npm Defintion File). Below you can find links to other repositories that contain Unity packages. These packages can - like any Unity package - be installed and used in your own projects. They usually contain eihter examples or modules that we use ourselves but that are not part of the code Needle Engine.
