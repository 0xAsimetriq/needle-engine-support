# Virtual and Augmented Reality

## Adding VR and AR capabilities to a scene

AR, VR and networking capabilites in Needle Engine are very modular. You can choose to not support any of them, or add only specific features. Here's how:  

### Basic capabilities
- **Enable AR and VR**  
  Add a `WebXR` component.  
  *Optional:* you can set a custom avatar by referencing an [Avatar Prefab](#avatars).   
  By default a very basic `DefaultAvatar` is assigned.
  
- **Enable Teleportings**  
  Add a `TeleportTarget` component to object hierarchies that can be teleported on.  
  To exclude specific objects, set their layer to `IgnoreRaycasting`.  

- **Enable going into Miniature Mode**  
  Pointing onto a surface and pressing <kb>A</kb> on a controller switches between 1:10 scale (miniature mode) and 1:1 scale.  
  We're planning to add a component to have more control over this functionality.  

### Multiplayer
- **Enable Networking**  
  Add a `SyncedRoom` component.

- **Enable Desktop Viewer Sync**  
  Add a `SyncedCamera` component.

- **Enable XR Avatar Sync**  
  Add a `WebXRSync` component.
  
- **Enable Voice Chat**  
  Add a `VoIP` component.

> **Note**: these components can be anywhere inside your `GltfObject` hierarchy. They can also all be on the same GameObject.

### Special AR Components

- **Define the AR Session Root and Scale**  
  Add a `WebARSessionRoot` component to your root object.  
  Here you can define the user scale to shrink (< 1) or enlarge (> 1) the user in relation to the scene when entering AR.

### Controlling object display for XR

- **Define whether an object is visible in Browser, AR, VR, First Person, Third Person**  
  Add a `XR Flag` component to the object you want to control. Change options on the dropdown as needed.  
  
  Common usecases are
  - hiding floors when entering AR
  - hiding Avatar parts in First or Third Person views (e.g. first-person head shouldn't be visible).

## Avatars

While we don't currently provide an out-of-the-box integration external avatar systems, you can create application-specific avatars or custom systems.  

- **Create a custom Avatar**  
  - Create an empty GameObject as avatar root
  - Add an object named `Head` and add a `XRFlag` that's set to Third Person
  - Add objects named `HandLeft` and `HandRight`
  - Add your graphics below these objects.

- **Assign Random Player Colors**  
  As an example for avatar customization, you can add a `PlayerColor` component to your renderers.  
  The randomized color is synchronized across objects using the script and across the network to other players.  

## HTML Content Overlays in AR  
    
If you want to display different html content whether the client is using a regular browser or using AR or VR, you can just use a set of html classes.  
This is controlled via HTML element classes. For example, to make content appear on desktop and in AR add a ``<div class="desktop ar"> ... </div>`` inside the `<needle-tiny>` tag:  

```html
<needle-tiny src="loadScene">
    <div class="desktop ar" style="pointer-events:none;">
        your content for AR and desktop goes here
    </div>
</needle-tiny>
```

## Limitations for WebXR on iOS

Due to Apple currently not supporting WebXR on iOS devices, Augmented Reality experiences on iOS are limited.  

A number of options and workarounds exist to still give iOS users _some_ AR:  

1. **Guiding users towards WebXR-compatible browsers on iOS.**
   Depending on your target audience, you can guide users on iOS towards for example Mozilla's [WebXR Viewer](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/webxr-viewer/id1295998056) to experience AR on iOS.  
   
3. **Exporting content on-the-fly as USDZ files.**  
   These files can be displayed on iOS devices in AR. They lack interactivity (besides a small set of built-in components) but can be sufficient for product configurators and similar relatively static usecases.
   An example is [Castle Builder](https://castle.needle.tools) where creations (not the live session) can be viewed in AR.
   - The [three.js USDZ converter](https://threejs.org/examples/misc_exporter_usdz.html) can be used like any other three.js example to create and view USDZ files at runtime.

  **[Encryption in Space](https://accurate-tree-observation.glitch.me/)** uses this approach. Players can collaboratively build scenes on their screens and then view the results in AR on iOS. On Android, they can also build in WebXR.  

2. **Using camera access and custom algorithms on iOS devices.**  
   It's to request camera image access and run custom algorithms to determine device pose.  
   While we don't provide built-in components for this, here's a few references to libraries and frameworks that we want to try in the future:  
   - [AR.js](https://github.com/AR-js-org/AR.js) (open source)
   - [Mind AR](https://github.com/hiukim/mind-ar-js) (open source)
   - [8th Wall](https://www.8thwall.com/) (commercial)
