# Prerequisites üíø
- [nodejs ‚á°](https://nodejs.org/en/) (required)
- [Unity 2020.3.x ‚á°](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) (required)
- [vscode ‚á°](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (recommended)

# Getting started üõé

## Authentication  

*Needs to be setup once per machine*  

1) Please open ``starter/Authenticate`` with Unity.
2) It will automatically open a window to ``ProjectSettings/Package Manager/Credentials``. 
3) Click the ``+`` icon to add your user credentials for the needle package registry.
4) Enter ``https://packages.needle.tools`` in the **Registry URL** field.
5) Open [https://packages.needle.tools ‚á°](https://packages.needle.tools) in your browser and login (top right corner) with your github account. Then click the ``i`` icon in the top right corner and copy auth token (last row, you can just click the copy icon).
6) Focus Unity and enter the token in the **Token** field.
7) Click save and close Unity. You should now have access rights to the needle package registry.

## Quick start
Open the project in ``starter/Unity_2020_3`` for a Unity ‚Üí threejs project ready to run.

## Unity setup

*For the purpose of this guide we will use the Unity project at **projects/Unity-Threejs_2020_3** and we would recommend you do the same.*

Open ``Edit/Project Settings`` and find ``Needle/threejs Exporter``. Select the directory for the needle runtime package (``Local js package``) and for the local threejs module (``Local threejs``). 

### Creating a new project
To create a new project [create a new Unity scene ‚á°](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CreatingScenes.html). For exporting to threejs add an ``ExportInfo`` component on one of your GameObjects in the scene. We recommend to mark this GameObject with the ``EditorOnly`` [tag ‚á°](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Tags.html) to avoid exporting settings objects.

Choose a directory for your threejs project in the ``ExportInfo`` component. If the directory does not exist or does not contain a threejs project yet click the ``Generate Project`` button.   
Note that Unity is automatically running ``npm install`` in the newly generated project. Wait for the installation to finish. If chrome did not open automatically after the installation finished try clicking the ``Play`` button in the Unity editor. It will start a local server and open chrome at port 3000. Allow the unsecure connection: now you should see the default Unity skybox in your browser.  
‚≠ê **Congrats!** You just built your first project using Unity to threejs!


#### **Tips**
- For future projects start with one of our Unity scene templates (e.g. Basic) for even faster project creation in just a few clicks.
- You can also **create your own templates** using ``Create/Scene Template``: [documentation ‚á°](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/scene-templates.html)

#### **Troubleshooting**
- The local server does not start
    - Try opening your threejs project directory in a command line tool and run ``npm install`` and then ``npm run dev-host``. Make sure both the local runtime package (``node_modules/needle.tiny.engine``) as well as threejs (``node_modules/three``) did install. You may run ``npm install`` in both of these directories as well.
- The skybox is broken
    - Try rebuilding the project in Unity (``ExportInfo/Build``) - this is a known issue and happens sometimes but will hopefully be fixed at some point.
