## The future of the web

We believe the web will expand considerably in the next years. While today native apps are the norm, more and more content is made available as a web app or [PWA](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/).  New VR and AR devices will extend into the web, creating an interesting problem: responsive suddenly doesn't only need "small screen" or "large screen", suddenly you're also dealing with spaces, 3D, spatial placement and potentially glasses and controllers!  
Add to that a push towards more interactivity and collaboration, and you have an interesting mix of challenges.  

At Needle, we believe thinking about this should be easy. That's why we're baking the ability to deploy to AR and VR right into our core components, and continually test that new ideas to work across platforms.
